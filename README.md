This project involves the implementation of six web programming exercises, focusing on the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to create interactive web pages with functionalities such as background color change, list manipulation, text visibility control, style changes on events, and more.
Each exercise provides an opportunity to understand and apply core web development concepts, such as DOM manipulation, events, styling with CSS, and interactivity with JavaScript.
